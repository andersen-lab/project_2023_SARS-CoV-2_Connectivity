### Data
Directory contains data necessary to repeat analyses of paper, with one major exception. 
Due to GISAID's Access Agreement, it seems that we're not able to reupload GISAID metadata. 
This file is referenced in many analysis notebooks as `gisaid_metadata.csv`.

The table below lists the contents of this directory. Files with sources that are `N/A` were generated as part of this work.
