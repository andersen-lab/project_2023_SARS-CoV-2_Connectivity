### Analyses
Directory contains jupyter notebooks necessary to repeat analyses of paper. 
Most figures/panels have their own notebook, though occassionally they are merged into one. 
For instance, Supplemental figure 8 is generated by `figure2_jumps-into-san-diego.ipynb`.
Child directories contain scripts to prepare input epidemiological and genomic data (Ex. `generate-california-border-tree`). 

Individual figure panels are saved in the `plots` directory.
